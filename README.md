Let the directions finish, listen for the choices, the monster will state each choice again separately and after you hear the choice you wish to choose, make a loud sound.
3 Decisions:
- Trade choice:
	- Banker
	- Carpenter
	- Farmer

These change the odds, banker being the highest success rate.

Although the success rate is higher, the score multiplier is lowest for the banker.
Ford the River: Ford
Float the wagon Bear Trap:
	- Chop their arm off
	- Attempt to free their arm
	- Leave them for dead

After this choice, your score will be calculated. Each choice you made has different percent chances of success based at random. The higher the risk, the great the point reward.
Can you become a ‘True Trail champion’?
